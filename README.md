Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the systematic development of high quality software products using engineering principles.
It enables creatoin of reliable scalableand innovative software solutions that meets user needs.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languanges like Fortnan and C
2. Establishment of software development as a discipline in the 1960s
3. the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
4. rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation- writing code and building the software according to design specification
4. Testing-conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standardsand functional requirements
5. Deployment- releasing software to users
6. Maintenance- providing ongoing supports updates and enhancements to software after development 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall-sequential approaches with distinct phases flowing downwards eg requirements and design implementation
Agile-iterative and incremental approachon flexibility collaboration and response to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer writes codes and implements software solutions
2. Quality assurance manager- ensures quality by designing and executing tests plan
3. Project Manager- oversees planning execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- software suits that provide compehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code eg;Visual studio
VCS- tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work with team members eg JUnit

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges include
1. Changing requirement.
2. Tight deadlines.
3. Technical debt
   Strategies include:
1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. Prioritization of tasks and regular assesment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit- testing individual components of software
2. intergration- tests interaction between different subsystems
3. system- tests the entire software system
4. acceptance- tests software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
They are important in code reviews and automated tests and continuos intergration help identify and fix defects in the development stage which leads to higher quality
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is crafting of statements that get the best possible reponse from AI models
It is important since it bridges the gap between chatbots and humans as it enables AI to give better response
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague;Tell me about a cat
Specific;Tell me about local household cats
